========================================================
Predicting with different quantile interpolation methods
========================================================

An example comparison of interpolation methods that can be applied during
prediction when the desired quantile lies between two data points.

This example was heavily inspired by `quantile-forest <https://github.com/zillow/quantile-forest>`_
package. See their package `here <https://zillow.github.io/quantile-forest/>`_.

# Generate the data
# -----------------
# We use four simple data points to illustrate the difference between the intervals that are
# generated using different interpolation methods.

# The interpolation methods
# -------------------------
# The following interpolation methods demonstrated here are:
# To interpolate between the data points, i and j (``i <= j``),
# linear, lower, higher, midpoint, or nearest. For more details, see `sktree.RandomForestRegressor`.
# The difference between the methods can be illustrated with the following example:
